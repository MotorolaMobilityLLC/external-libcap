This is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e (formerly POSIX 6)
draft 15 capabilities.

This library would not have been possible without the help of 

	Aleph1, Roland Buresund and Andrew Main, Alexander Kjeldaas.

More information on capabilities in the Linux kernel can be found at

	http://linux.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/

# INSTALLATION

	Linux-Caps % make

		builds the library and the programs

	Linux-Caps % make install

		installs the library libcap.XX.Y in /lib/
		the binaries in /bin/
		the <sys/capability.h> file in /usr/include

* for some example programs look in progs.

Cheers
